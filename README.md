# MinJoin++ SD Detection Project
This project is conducted under the Student Research Project Program (PSI), organized by the Association for the Advancement of Science and Technology in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It aims to improve the detection of segmental duplications (SDs) in the human genome. The primary objective is to assess the performance of the MinJoin++ algorithm in approximating string similarity for SD detection and to compare its effectiveness against established MinHash-based methods, including SEDEF and BISER.
